I've grown accustomed to documentation writen by open-source companies. These are excellently maintained, and more educational than simply descriptive. 

You are a potential customer, so good documentation is part of the product, this is often not the case for powerful ML repos and APIs (pytorch-lightning not included).

Even parts of the API that are well documented simply state what something is, not when you'd want to use it nor why you care. Why you care is how people learn.
