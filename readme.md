Original docs are very limited, and many important and complex GitHub issues have overly simplistic responses.

This repo and the associated docs aims to plug this gap.

Will write docs with mkdocs and sort out CI/CD for it.

We can use this, https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/ it's what creates this  https://baal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/research/

Also, a lot of credit goes to BinIt AI where I've been able to use this tooling to build accurate Object Detection models for the Recycling Industry. While this is my own initiative, and will mostly be managed in my spare time, much of my learning has come during the working day. And resolutions to various bugs have been as a necessity to get models up and running for a variety of problems, for different compute requirements.
